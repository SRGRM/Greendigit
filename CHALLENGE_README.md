# GreenDIGIT ECML PKDD 2026 Challenge

This repository contains starter kits for two related tasks:

- [Task A](task-a/README.md): forecast site-level energy and carbon signals, plus missing-signal and peak-event detection.
- [Task B](task-b/README.md): use Task A forecasts in a forecast-driven sustainable job scheduling simulator.

Shared data lives in [data/](data/). Task A and Task B should be installed in
separate virtual environments because they expose separate Python packages and
CLIs.

## Challenge Description

The challenge provides a public dataset for participants to train, develop, and
validate their solutions. Final evaluation will use a private dataset,
corresponding to later months in the same data collection, to assess how well
submissions generalize beyond the public data.

The data is available both in this GitHub repository and in the Challenge VRE
folders. Both locations include the aggregated datasets. Raw granular data is
available only through the VRE because of its larger size, in `.csv` and `.zip`
formats. If you are not able to find the data, please contact the challenge
organizers.

The Challenge VRE provides a ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook platform that
participants can use for dataset exploration, experimentation, and model
development. It is
available through the [Activate Challenge VRE](https://sobigdata.d4science.org/group/greendigit_pkdd2026_challenge/jupyterhub-at-google-cloud)
link, also listed above.

## Submission Guidelines
| ⚠️ ⚠️ <ins>**Submissions must be made through the [submission form](https://forms.gle/4z1itungej5HEkLW9).**</ins> ⚠️ ⚠️

Participants should submit their final solution through the submission form. 
The submission must include: 
- Artefacts ZIP (`artefacts.zip`) which should include all source code, configuration files, dependency specifications, and instructions required to reproduce the submitted results.
- A final report (`report.pdf`) of up to 4 pages.

**Additional notes:**
- The repository should include all source code, configuration files, dependency specifications, and instructions required to reproduce the submitted results.
- Participants are expected to use the official challenge repository as the starting point and preserve the expected structure, interfaces, and evaluation workflow. They may extend the repository with their own model code, dependencies, and documentation.

For questions about the submission process, participants should contact the organising team in advance  [PKDDChallenge@SoBigData.uva](mailto:PKDDChallenge@SoBigData.uva).

Each submission must include a README.md file with the following section:

```
## Submission <team_name>
### Participants
| Name          | Email                                                 | Affiliation                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Participant 1 | participant1@email.com                                | Institution / Organisation |
| Participant 2 | participant2@email.com                                | Institution / Organisation |

### Reproducibility
Please provide the commands required to reproduce the submission.

#### Training
Provide the command used to train the model using the provided public training/development data.
Example:
python train.py --data path/to/public/training/data --output path/to/model

#### Testing / Inference
Provide the command used to run the trained model on a test dataset.
The testing command must allow the organising team to specify the path to the private test dataset used for final evaluation.
Example:
python test.py --model path/to/model --test-data path/to/private/test/data --output path/to/predictions
```
Submissions should be fully reproducible by the organising team using the provided instructions.

## Task A Quick Start

The commands below run the reference baseline end to end. Participants may
replace the baseline with their own forecasting model and submission-generation
code, as long as the output CSVs keep the documented Task A schemas.

```bash
cd task-a
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,server]"

./.venv/bin/task-a train-baseline
./.venv/bin/task-a predict
./.venv/bin/task-a predict-detection
./.venv/bin/task-a predict-peaks
./.venv/bin/task-a evaluate \
  --forecasts outputs/forecast_submission.csv \
  --detections outputs/detection_submission.csv \
  --peaks outputs/peak_submission.csv
```

Read [task-a/guidelines.md](task-a/guidelines.md) before preparing a submission.
It defines the required files and the evaluator files participants must not
change.

## Task B Quick Start

Task B can consume Task A forecasts in two ways:

- Offline mode reads a forecast CSV. The default file is the bundled
  `data/forecast_baseline.csv`, which is only a local starter forecast source.
- Live mode calls a Task A-compatible `POST /forecast` service. This is the
  participant path for evaluating Task B with predictions from their own Task A
  model.

```bash
cd task-b
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,server]"

./.venv/bin/python -m dirac_sim simulate --offline
```

Participants should use Live Mode when running Task B with their own Task A
predictions. To run Task B against a live Task A model, start a forecast server
from `task-a` in one terminal:

```bash
cd task-a
source .venv/bin/activate
TASK_A_MODEL=outputs/baseline_model.json \
./.venv/bin/uvicorn task_a.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then run Task B without `--offline` in another terminal:

```bash
cd task-b
source .venv/bin/activate
./.venv/bin/python -m dirac_sim simulate \
  --api-url http://localhost:8000 \
  --scheduler dirac_sim.baselines.greedy_carbon.GreedyCarbonScheduler
```

Participants can replace the example Task A server with their own service, as
long as it implements the `POST /forecast` contract described in
[task-b/README.md](task-b/README.md). Task B uses those forecast responses
during scheduling; it does not automatically read `task-a/outputs/` unless a
compatible CSV is passed with `--forecast-csv` in offline mode.

Read [task-b/README.md](task-b/README.md) before preparing a scheduler
submission. It defines the scheduler interface, output files, and evaluator
files participants must not change.
